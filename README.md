# 🛍️ Reliant Retail Ltd. – MySQL Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates real-world business analysis for *Reliant Retail Ltd.*, a fictional e-commerce company. Using a relational orders database, I answered 10 key business questions using advanced SQL techniques. The project covers customer segmentation, unsold product detection, inventory management, and logistics evaluation.

> **Goal:** Use MySQL to extract actionable insights from a multi-table transactional database to support data-driven decisions.
